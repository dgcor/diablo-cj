https://github.com/dgcor/diablo-cj

work in progress.

### Portable mode

To run in portable mode, create a folder `portable` next to the Diablo binary (current working directory).  

On Linux, if using an `AppImage`, create a folder with the same name as the AppImage ending with `.home`.

```
Diablo.AppImage         (file)
Diablo.AppImage.home    (folder)
```
